# Soccer-BI
This project aims to help Premier League teams managers to win or take better decisions with the use of different AI techniques in order to provide more data. With the use of Linear regression, we can predict how many points are necessary to stay in the first spots of the tournament and the necessary time per player to do their best in their respective position so the club maintains its goals. The use of polynomial regression is meant to help to buy decisions based on player statistics, predicting the type of player you need and how will perform based on previous data. All of this so the managers can have more information based on previous performance and how the league is behaving.
